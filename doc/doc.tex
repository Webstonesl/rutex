\section{Introduction}
\TeX{} is a typesetting system designed by Donald Knuth in 1978. It is widely
used in academia and the scientific community for the production of high-quality
documents. The system is based on the idea of separating content from
presentation, allowing authors to focus on the content of their documents while
the system takes care of the formatting. 

\subsection{Motivation}
The original \TeX{} system was written in the Pascal (WEB) programming language
making it difficult to maintain and extend. The goal of this project is to
rewrite the \TeX{} system in the Rust programming language, which is known for
its safety and performance. The project will be implemented in stages, starting
with a basic parser and macro expansion engine.
